# SEO BS Forecasting Calculator

The "SEO BS Forecast Calculator" is a dynamic tool designed to estimate the potential revenue impact of changes made to a website's search engine optimization (SEO) strategies. Whether these changes are intended to enhance or potentially degrade your site's traffic, understanding their financial implications is crucial for making informed decisions.

This tool specifically helps users predict how different SEO changes, classified as either "Positive" or "Negative," might affect their monthly traffic and, by extension, their revenue. Users can define the intensity of these changes using an impact scale that ranges from 1 (minimal impact) to 10 (maximum impact). Additionally, this tool introduces the concept of an "impact range," which allows users to explore outcomes under varying degrees of impact, addressing uncertainties in the SEO strategyâ€™s effect.

By providing inputs such as current and maximum traffic potentials, expected conversion rates, and conversion values, users receive a calculated range of potential revenue impacts. This range helps in planning and risk assessment, offering a clearer picture of potential changes in revenue due to SEO actions.
